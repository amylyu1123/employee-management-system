For the Employee Salary Management, it has two parts: Stat and Sql.
For both types of users:
In Stat Page, you can see different diagrams for current employees information. 
In Sql Page, you can see a table that contains the summary of the statistics of current employees information. 
If you are an administrator, you can also modify employee information by adding/deleting/editing/searching employee(s). 

You can login using the existing administrator's account to change other user's role into an administrator:
Username: admin
Password: admin
